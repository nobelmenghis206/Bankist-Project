# Bankist Project (Udemy)

This project is the result of my work during a comprehensive frontend development course on Udemy. I created this the power of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to craft an engaging marketing page for a fictitious financial institution known as "Bankist." The objective was to create a visually stunning and user-friendly webpage that showcases various advanced behavioral effects and interactivity.Feel free to explore this project to witness the culmination of my skills and learning journey in frontend web development. Your feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated.




##  Key Features


#### Lazy Loading Images
Employing the lazy loading technique, I ensured that images on the Bankist marketing page load efficiently, enhancing the overall user experience by reducing initial page load times.

#### Sticky Menu Bar
I implemented a sticky navigation menu bar that remains fixed at the top of the page as users scroll down, providing easy access to important sections of the website at all times.

####  Tab Components
Utilizing JavaScript, I incorporated tabbed components, enabling users to seamlessly switch between different sections of the content, improving navigation and readability.

### Additional Enhancements
Beyond these core features, the project incorporates several other advanced behaviors and effects ( a slide animation, scrolling animation, ) to create a dynamic and engaging user interface.
